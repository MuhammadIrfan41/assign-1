    Dear peter <br><br>
    <h2> Re:sales assistant vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</h2> <br><br>
    I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on <br> Trade Me
    on 14 February 2013. <br><br>

    I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the <br> position,
    including:

    <ul>
        <li>time management and strong organisational skills</li>
        <li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management
        </li>
        <li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
        <li> motivation and dedication</li>
    </ul>
    As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer <br> service
    skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The <br> Sales
    Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail <br> career.
    <br><br>


    I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use <br> my skills
    to benefit your organisation at an interview. <br><br>

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you. <br><br>

    Yours sincerely <br><br>

    Lizzie Long
